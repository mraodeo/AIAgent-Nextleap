# Problem Statement: Groww App Review Pulse Generator

## Objective
We need to build a system for the Groww platform ([Groww Stocks, Mutual Fund, IPO – Apps on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nextbillion.groww&hl=en_IN)). The goal is to turn raw mobile-store feedback into a weekly pulse your team can scan in minutes, highlighting what users care about, what they actually said, and what to do next. Reviews are already public; the job is to aggregate, theme, summarize, and deliver that insight through familiar surfaces—Google Docs for the written pulse and Gmail for a draft you can send yourself—without handling credentials or REST wiring yourself.

## End-to-End Flow (What "Done" Looks Like)
1. **Pull Reviews:** Fetch recent Play Store reviews for your product (within the rules below).
2. **Theme & Distill:** Cluster them into a small set of themes and distill a one-page weekly note.
3. **Publish to Docs:** Put that note where stakeholders can read it (Google Docs).
4. **Draft Email:** Create a draft email to yourself (or an alias) that contains or links to that pulse (Gmail).

## Deliverables
A weekly one-page pulse that must include:
- **Top themes:** What people are talking about most.
- **Real user quotes:** Verbatim snippets from reviews (no invented wording).
- **Three action ideas:** Concrete next steps grounded in the themes.

Finally, the system must send a draft email containing this weekly note (or a clear pointer to it).

## Who This Helps
| Audience | Why |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Product / Growth** | Prioritize fixes and improvements from real signals |
| **Support** | Align messaging with what users are actually saying |
| **Leadership** | One-page health check without drowning in raw reviews |

## What You Must Build
1. **Import reviews:** From roughly the last 8–12 weeks (fields such as rating, title, text, date—whatever your export provides).
2. **Group reviews:** Into at most 5 themes (examples: onboarding, KYC, payments, statements, withdrawals—pick what fits your product).
3. **Generate a weekly one-page note with:**
   - Top 3 themes (subset of your themes as appropriate)
   - 3 user quotes
   - 3 action ideas
4. **Draft an email:** With the note to yourself or an alias.

## Integrations: Google Docs & Gmail via MCP
Use MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers for Google Docs and Gmail—for example, creating or updating the pulse document and creating the draft message—rather than integrating Google APIs directly. There should be no bespoke OAuth client + REST client code as the primary integration path. 
MCP servers expose tools your agent or app can call; lean on that pattern so Docs and Gmail stay consistent with the course tooling and avoid duplicating auth and HTTP plumbing. *(Choose MCP servers or connectors your environment provides for Docs and Gmail; the requirement is MCP-first, not "call Google APIs manually.")*

## Key Constraints
- **Reviews:** Use public review exports only—no scraping behind store logins or ToS-violating automation.
- **Themes:** Maximum 5 themes for clustering; the written pulse highlights the top 3.
- **Length:** Keep the note scannable and ≤250 words where applicable.
- **Privacy:** Do not include PII—no usernames, emails, device IDs, or other identifiable reviewer data in any artifact (quotes should be anonymous/stripped as needed).
